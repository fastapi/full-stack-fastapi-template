This contribution adds comprehensive Docker development tools and documentation to improve the developer experience.

## Files Added/Modified

### üìö Documentation
- **`DOCKER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`** - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide for common Docker issues
- **`scripts/README.md`** - Documentation for helper scripts
- **`README.md`** - Updated with Docker development section

### üõ†Ô∏è Helper Scripts
- **`scripts/docker-dev.sh`** - Linux/Mac Docker development helper script
- **`scripts/docker-dev.bat`** - Windows Docker development helper script  
- **`scripts/docker-health.sh`** - Quick health check script

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Files
- **`.dockerignore`** - Root-level Docker ignore file for optimized builds
- **`docker-compose.dev.yml`** - Development-specific Docker Compose configuration

## Key Features Added

### 1. Comprehensive Troubleshooting Guide
- Common Docker setup issues and solutions
- Service-specific debugging commands
- Performance optimization tips
- Step-by-step problem resolution

### 2. Development Helper Scripts
**Cross-platform support** (Linux/Mac/Windows):
- `setup` - Initial project setup with secret generation
- `start/stop` - Service management
- `restart/rebuild` - Individual service operations
- `reset` - Complete environment reset
- `status` - Health check with colored output
- `logs` - Service log viewing
- `db-reset` - Database reset functionality
- `shell` - Container shell access

### 3. Quick Health Monitoring
- Automated service health checks
- Visual status indicators
- Quick access URLs display
- Failure diagnostics

### 4. Build Optimizations
- Root `.dockerignore` for faster builds
- Development-specific compose configuration
- Hot reload setup for development

## Developer Experience Improvements

### Before
- Manual Docker commands
- No centralized troubleshooting
- Repetitive setup tasks
- Unclear error resolution

### After
- One-command setup: `./scripts/docker-dev.sh setup`
- Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- Automated health checks
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Colored output for better UX

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Quick setup
./scripts/docker-dev.sh setup

# Check everything is working
./scripts/docker-health.sh

# View backend logs
./scripts/docker-dev.sh logs backend

# Reset everything
./scripts/docker-dev.sh reset

# Get help
./scripts/docker-dev.sh help
```

## Impact

### For New Contributors
- Faster onboarding with automated setup
- Clear troubleshooting when issues arise
- Reduced barrier to entry

### For Existing Developers
- Streamlined daily workflow
- Less time debugging Docker issues
- Consistent development environment

### For Maintainers
- Fewer Docker-related support requests
- Standardized development setup
- Better issue reporting with health checks

## Testing Performed

- ‚úÖ Scripts work on Windows (batch files)
- ‚úÖ Scripts work on Linux/Mac (shell scripts)
- ‚úÖ All Docker operations function correctly
- ‚úÖ Health checks accurately report status
- ‚úÖ Troubleshooting guide covers real scenarios
- ‚úÖ Documentation is clear and actionable
