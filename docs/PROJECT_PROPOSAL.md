# Project Proposal — SecureNotes (FastAPI)

**Course:** Secure Software Development
**Project Theme:** REST API Security (FastAPI) — fork of tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql
**Repository (fork):** [https://github.com/YourGitHubUser/secure-notes](https://github.com/YourGitHubUser/secure-notes)

**Implementer (Phase 1):** [Your Full Name]

* Produce Level-0 DFD (docs/system_overview.*).
* Setup initial README and changelog.

## Deliverables (Phase 1)

* docs/PROJECT_PROPOSAL.md
* docs/SECURITY_PLAN.md
* docs/system_overview.png and .pdf
* README.md and CHANGELOG.md
* Branch: phase1-setup and PR to main

## Team & responsibilities

* [Your Full Name] — Phase 1: planning, repo setup, DFD, documentation.
* (Teammates will implement later phases: threat modeling, code, tests).

## Timeline

* Phase 1: (today) Planning & Setup
* Phase 2: Threat Model & Risk Assessment
* Phase 3: Implementation (backend security controls)
* Phase 4: CI/CD & automated security scans
* Phase 5: Final report & demo
