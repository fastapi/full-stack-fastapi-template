# Contributing Guidelines

## Before Starting

1. **Setup**: Follow the [Setup Guide](./setup.md)
2. **Development**: Read [Development Workflow](./development.md)
3. **Discussions**: For big changes, open a GitHub Discussion first

## What Counts as a Big Change?

**Requires discussion:**
- New features or architectural changes
- Significant refactoring
- Breaking API changes
- Removal of functionality

**Can go straight to PR:**
- Typos and grammar fixes
- Small reproducible bug fixes
- Lint warnings or type errors
- Minor code improvements
- Documentation updates

## Code Standards

### General Principles

- Follow existing code style in the project
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Keep functions focused and small
- Handle errors explicitly
- Update docs when changing architecture

### Backend (Python)

```python
# Follow these conventions
snake_case_for_functions_and_files
PascalCaseForClasses

# Use type hints
def get_user(user_id: int) -> User:
    """Get user by ID.

    Args:
        user_id: The user's unique identifier

    Returns:
        User object or None if not found
    """
    return db.get(User, user_id)

# Handle errors explicitly
if not user:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")
```

Linting tools ensure compliance:
- `ruff check` - linting (isort, pyflakes, pyupgrade, etc.)
- `ruff format` - code formatting
- `mypy` - type checking (strict mode enabled)

**Check before committing:**

```bash
cd backend
uv run prek run --all-files
uv run pytest tests/ -v  # All tests must pass
```

### Frontend (TypeScript)

```typescript
// PascalCase for components
export function UserCard() {
  return <div>User</div>
}

// Use @/ path alias for imports
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

// Double quotes, no semicolons
const message = "Hello world"

// Explicit error handling
if (!user) {
  throw new Error("User not found")
}
```

Linting tools ensure compliance:
- `biome check --write` - linting and formatting
- `tsc` - type checking

**Check before committing:**

```bash
cd frontend
bun run lint
bunx playwright test  # All tests must pass
```

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Create Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/STORY-123-description
```

Use pattern: `feature/STORY-XXX-description`, `fix/STORY-XXX-description`, etc.

### 2. Write Tests First (TDD)

Before implementing, write tests that define expected behavior:

**Backend example:**

```python
# backend/tests/api/test_users.py
def test_create_user():
    response = client.post(
        "/api/v1/users",
        json={"email": "new@example.com", "full_name": "New User"}
    )
    assert response.status_code == 201
    data = response.json()
    assert data["email"] == "new@example.com"
```

**Frontend example:**

```typescript
// frontend/tests/auth.spec.ts
test('should login successfully', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:5173/login')
  await page.fill('input[name="email"]', 'admin@example.com')
  await page.fill('input[name="password"]', 'password123')
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]')
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard')
})
```

### 3. Implement Feature

Write minimum code to make tests pass, then refactor.

### 4. Run All Checks

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
uv run prek run --all-files  # Linting, formatting, type checking
uv run pytest tests/ -v      # All tests must pass
uv run coverage report --fail-under=90  # Coverage must be >=90%
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
bun run lint                 # Linting and formatting
bunx playwright test         # All tests must pass
```

### 5. Commit with Conventional Format

```
type(scope): subject line

Body explaining what and why. Keep it focused.

Fixes TASK-123
Related to STORY-120

Generated by Aygentic
Co-Authored-By: Aygentic <noreply@aygentic.com>
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`

**Examples:**

```
feat(users): add email verification flow

Implement email verification with token-based confirmation.
User receives email with verification link.

Fixes TASK-456
Related to STORY-120
```

```
fix(api): resolve cors header mismatch

Updated BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS to include staging domain.

Fixes TASK-789
```

### 6. Push & Open PR

```bash
git push origin feature/STORY-123-description
```

Create PR with:
- Clear title (what changed)
- Description of why (problem being solved)
- Related issue reference
- Testing instructions if needed

### 7. Address Feedback

Maintainers may request changes. Update code and push again - the PR updates automatically.

## Commit Guidelines

### General Rules

- Commits should be logical units of work
- One feature per commit if possible
- Messages should explain **why**, not just **what**
- Include related issue/story in footer

### Automated Tools

The `commit-messages` skill automatically:
- Enforces conventional commit format
- Validates Linear issue references
- Ensures Aygentic attribution

You don't need to do anything - it runs before every commit.

## Merge & Cleanup

Once approved:
1. All checks must pass (GitHub Actions)
2. Maintainer merges to main
3. Feature branch is automatically deleted
4. If closing an issue, add `Closes #123` to PR description

## Local Testing Before Submission

### Full Integration Test

Test the entire stack before pushing:

```bash
# Run all checks
cd backend && uv run prek run --all-files && uv run pytest tests/ -v
cd ../frontend && bun run lint && bunx playwright test

# Verify in browser
# Open http://localhost:5173 and http://localhost:8000/docs
# Test your feature manually
```

### Docker Test

Verify it works in Docker:

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d
# Wait for startup
docker compose logs backend | grep "ready"

# Test in browser
# Open http://localhost:5173
```

## Automated Code & AI Tools

You're encouraged to use tools to work efficiently, including AI tools.

**Important:** Contributions must have meaningful human effort:
- If human effort < effort needed to review, don't submit
- We can run automated tools ourselves faster than reviewing external PRs
- Copy-pasted LLM output in descriptions will be flagged

**Use tools wisely:**
- LLM for generating boilerplate and tests
- AI for refactoring suggestions
- Automated tools for formatting and linting
- But always review and understand what you're submitting

## Getting Help

### Questions?

- Open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/your-org/repo/discussions)
- Check existing issues and discussions
- Review [Development Workflow](./development.md)

### Issues with Tests?

- Check test logs: `docker compose logs backend`
- Run test with more verbosity: `uv run pytest tests/ -vv --tb=short`
- Debug with: `uv run pytest tests/test_file.py::test_name -vv --pdb`

### Issues with Linting?

- Check what `prek` found: `uv run prek run --all-files`
- Auto-fix where possible: `uv run ruff check --fix`
- Review [Code Standards](#code-standards) section
