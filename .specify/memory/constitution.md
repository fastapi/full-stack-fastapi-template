# Full Stack FastAPI Template Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Full-Stack Integration (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every feature MUST be implemented across the entire stack - backend API, frontend UI, database schema, and tests. No feature is complete without end-to-end functionality. This ensures the template remains production-ready and demonstrates complete implementation patterns for users.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD is mandatory for all new features: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced. All features MUST have unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests before implementation begins.

### III. Auto-Generated Client Consistency
The frontend client MUST be automatically generated from backend OpenAPI schemas. Any API changes MUST trigger client regeneration. Manual API client modifications are forbidden to maintain consistency and prevent drift between backend and frontend.

### IV. Docker-First Development
All development and deployment MUST use Docker Compose. Local development MUST mirror production environment. Features MUST work in containerized environment before local development alternatives are considered.

### V. Security by Default
All new features MUST implement secure defaults: JWT authentication, password hashing, CORS configuration, input validation, and SQL injection prevention. Security considerations MUST be documented in feature specifications.

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Standards
- Pre-commit hooks MUST run before any commit (linting, formatting, type checking)
- All Python code MUST pass Ruff linting and formatting checks
- All TypeScript/JavaScript MUST pass ESLint and Prettier checks
- Code coverage MUST maintain minimum thresholds (backend: 80%, frontend: 70%)

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests MUST cover all business logic and utility functions
- Integration tests MUST verify API endpoints and database interactions
- End-to-end tests MUST validate complete user workflows
- Contract tests MUST ensure API schema consistency

### Documentation Standards
- All new features MUST include API documentation via OpenAPI/Swagger
- User-facing features MUST have updated README sections
- Complex business logic MUST include inline documentation
- Deployment changes MUST update deployment.md

## Quality Standards

### Performance Requirements
- API endpoints MUST respond within 200ms for 95th percentile
- Frontend pages MUST load within 2 seconds
- Database queries MUST be optimized and indexed appropriately
- Docker containers MUST start within 30 seconds

### Accessibility Standards
- All UI components MUST meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Forms MUST have proper labels and validation messages
- Navigation MUST be keyboard accessible
- Color contrast MUST meet accessibility requirements

## Security Requirements

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens MUST use secure secret keys (minimum 32 characters)
- Password requirements MUST enforce complexity standards
- Session management MUST implement proper expiration
- Role-based access control MUST be implemented for admin features

### Data Protection
- All user input MUST be validated and sanitized
- Database queries MUST use parameterized statements
- Sensitive data MUST be encrypted at rest
- API endpoints MUST implement rate limiting

### Infrastructure Security
- Docker images MUST use non-root users
- Environment variables MUST be properly secured
- HTTPS MUST be enforced in production
- Secrets MUST NOT be committed to version control

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. Amendments require:
1. Documentation of the proposed change and rationale
2. Impact assessment on existing features and templates
3. Approval through pull request review process
4. Migration plan for any breaking changes

All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with constitutional principles. Complexity additions MUST be justified with clear business value and technical necessity. Use development.md and deployment.md for runtime development guidance.
