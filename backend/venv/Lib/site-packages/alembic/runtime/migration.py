    :class:`.MigrationContext` is the front end to an actual
    database connection, or alternatively a string output

    When inside the ``env.py`` script, the :class:`.MigrationContext`
    is available via the

    which is available at ``alembic.context``::

        # from within env.py script
        from alembic import context

        migration_context = context.get_context()

    For usage outside of an ``env.py`` script, such as for
    utility routines that want to check the current version
    in the database, the :meth:`.MigrationContext.configure`
    method to create new :class:`.MigrationContext` objects.
    For example, to get at the current revision in the
    database using :meth:`.MigrationContext.get_current_revision`::

        # in any application, outside of an env.py script
        from alembic.migration import MigrationContext

        context = MigrationContext.configure(conn)
        current_rev = context.get_current_revision()

    The above context can also be used to produce
    Alembic migration operations with an :class:`.Operations`
    instance::

        # in any application, outside of the normal Alembic environment

        isolation levels.

        This special directive is intended to support the occasional database
        DDL or system operation that specifically has to be run outside of
        any kind of transaction block.   The PostgreSQL database platform
        is the most common target for this style of operation, as many
        of its DDL operations must be run outside of transaction blocks, even
        though the database overall supports transactional DDL.

        The method is used as a context manager within a migration script, by
        calling on :meth:`.Operations.get_context` to retrieve the
        :class:`.MigrationContext`, then invoking
        :meth:`.MigrationContext.autocommit_block` using the ``with:``
        statement::

            def upgrade():
                with op.get_context().autocommit_block():
                    op.execute("ALTER TYPE mood ADD VALUE 'soso'")

        Above, a PostgreSQL "ALTER TYPE..ADD VALUE" directive is emitted,
        which must be run outside of a transaction block at the database level.
        The :meth:`.MigrationContext.autocommit_block` method makes use of the
        SQLAlchemy ``AUTOCOMMIT`` isolation level setting, which against the
        psycogp2 DBAPI corresponds to the ``connection.autocommit`` setting,
        to ensure that the database driver is not inside of a DBAPI level
        transaction block.

        .. warning::

            As is necessary, **the database transaction preceding the block is
            unconditionally committed**.  This means that the run of migrations
            preceding the operation will be committed, before the overall
            migration operation is complete.

            It is recommended that when an application includes migrations with
            "autocommit" blocks, that
            :paramref:`.EnvironmentContext.transaction_per_migration` be used
            so that the calling environment is tuned to expect short per-file
            migrations whether or not one of them has an autocommit block.
