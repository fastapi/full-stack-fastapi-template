        """Invoke a series of per-table migrations in batch.

        Batch mode allows a series of operations specific to a table
        to be syntactically grouped together, and allows for alternate
        modes of table migration, in particular the "recreate" style of
        migration required by SQLite.

        "recreate" style is as follows:

        1. A new table is created with the new specification, based on the
           migration directives within the batch, using a temporary name.

        2. the data copied from the existing table to the new table.

        3. the existing table is dropped.

        4. the new table is renamed to the existing table name.

        The directive by default will only use "recreate" style on the
        SQLite backend, and only if directives are present which require
        this form, e.g. anything other than ``add_column()``.   The batch
        operation on other backends will proceed using standard ALTER TABLE
        operations.

        The method is used as a context manager, which returns an instance
        of :class:`.BatchOperations`; this object is the same as
        :class:`.Operations` except that table names and schema names
        are omitted.  E.g.::

            with op.batch_alter_table("some_table") as batch_op:
                batch_op.add_column(Column("foo", Integer))
                batch_op.drop_column("bar")

        The operations within the context manager are invoked at once
        when the context is ended.   When run against SQLite, if the
        migrations include operations not supported by SQLite's ALTER TABLE,
        the entire table will be copied to a new one with the new
        specification, moving all data across as well.

        The copy operation by default uses reflection to retrieve the current
        structure of the table, and therefore :meth:`.batch_alter_table`
        in this mode requires that the migration is run in "online" mode.
        The ``copy_from`` parameter may be passed which refers to an existing
        :class:`.Table` object, which will bypass this reflection step.

        .. note::  The table copy operation will currently not copy
           CHECK constraints, and may not copy UNIQUE constraints that are
           unnamed, as is possible on SQLite.   See the section
           :ref:`sqlite_batch_constraints` for workarounds.

        :param table_name: name of table
        :param schema: optional schema name.
        :param recreate: under what circumstances the table should be
         recreated. At its default of ``"auto"``, the SQLite dialect will
         recreate the table if any operations other than ``add_column()``,
         ``create_index()``, or ``drop_index()`` are
         present. Other options include ``"always"`` and ``"never"``.
        :param copy_from: optional :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Table` object
         that will act as the structure of the table being copied.  If omitted,
         table reflection is used to retrieve the structure of the table.

         :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Table` using
         :paramref:`~.Operations.batch_alter_table.copy_from`.
        :param reflect_kwargs: a dictionary of additional keyword arguments
         that will be applied to the table structure being copied; this may be
         used to pass additional table and reflection options to the table that
         will be reflected, in lieu of passing the whole
         :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Table` using
         :paramref:`~.Operations.batch_alter_table.copy_from`.
        :param table_args: a sequence of additional positional arguments that
         will be applied to the new :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Table` when
         created, in addition to those copied from the source table.
         This may be used to provide additional constraints such as CHECK
         constraints that may not be reflected.
        :param table_kwargs: a dictionary of additional keyword arguments
         that will be applied to the new :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Table`
         when created, in addition to those copied from the source table.
         This may be used to provide for additional table options that may
         not be reflected.
        :param naming_convention: a naming convention dictionary of the form
         described at :ref:`autogen_naming_conventions` which will be applied
         to the :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.MetaData` during the reflection
         process.  This is typically required if one wants to drop SQLite
         constraints, as these constraints will not have names when
         reflected on this backend.  Requires SQLAlchemy **0.9.4** or greater.

         .. seealso::

            :ref:`dropping_sqlite_foreign_keys`

        :param partial_reordering: a list of tuples, each suggesting a desired
         ordering of two or more columns in the newly created table.  Requires
         that :paramref:`.batch_alter_table.recreate` is set to ``"always"``.
         Examples, given a table with columns "a", "b", "c", and "d":

         Specify the order of all columns::

            with op.batch_alter_table(
                "some_table",
                recreate="always",
                partial_reordering=[("c", "d", "a", "b")],
            ) as batch_op:
                pass

         Ensure "d" appears before "c", and "b", appears before "a"::

            with op.batch_alter_table(
                "some_table",
                recreate="always",
                partial_reordering=[("d", "c"), ("b", "a")],
            ) as batch_op:
                pass

         The ordering of columns not included in the partial_reordering
         set is undefined.   Therefore it is best to specify the complete
         ordering of all columns for best results.

        .. note:: batch mode requires SQLAlchemy 0.8 or above.

        When using Alembic in "offline" mode, CRUD operations

        literal values,
        which is that they are converted into bound values and passed
        separately into the ``execute()`` method of the DBAPI cursor.
        An offline SQL
        script needs to have these rendered inline.  While it should

        security hole in an application that handles untrusted input,

        See :meth:`.Operations.execute` for an example usage of
        :meth:`.Operations.inline_literal`.

        The environment can also be configured to attempt to render
        "literal" values inline automatically, for those simple types
        that are supported by the dialect; see

            as producing the column's default value on the database side are
            specified using the ``server_default`` parameter, and not ``default``
            which only specifies Python-side defaults::

            Generally, only that aspect of the column which
            is being changed, i.e. name, type, nullability,
            default, needs to be specified.  Multiple changes
            can also be specified at once and the backend should
            "do the right thing", emitting each change either
            separately or together as the backend allows.

            MySQL has special requirements here, since MySQL
            cannot ALTER a column without a full specification.
            When producing MySQL-compatible migration files,
            it is recommended that the ``existing_type``,
            ``existing_server_default``, and ``existing_nullable``
            parameters be present, if not being altered.

            Type changes which are against the SQLAlchemy
            "schema" types :class:`~sqlalchemy.types.Boolean`
            and  :class:`~sqlalchemy.types.Enum` may also
            add or drop constraints which accompany those
            types on backends that don't support them natively.
            The ``existing_type`` argument is
            used in this case to identify and remove a previous
            constraint that was bound to the type object.

            :param table_name: string name of the target table.
            :param column_name: string name of the target column,
             as it exists before the operation begins.
            :param nullable: Optional; specify ``True`` or ``False``
             to alter the column's nullability.
            :param server_default: Optional; specify a string
             SQL expression, :func:`~sqlalchemy.sql.expression.text`,
             or :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.DefaultClause` to indicate
             an alteration to the column's default value.
             Set to ``None`` to have the default removed.
            :param comment: optional string text of a new comment to add to the
             column.
            :param new_column_name: Optional; specify a string name here to
             indicate the new name within a column rename operation.
            :param type\_: Optional; a :class:`~sqlalchemy.types.TypeEngine`
             type object to specify a change to the column's type.
             For SQLAlchemy types that also indicate a constraint (i.e.
             :class:`~sqlalchemy.types.Boolean`, :class:`~sqlalchemy.types.Enum`),
             the constraint is also generated.
            :param autoincrement: set the ``AUTO_INCREMENT`` flag of the column;
             currently understood by the MySQL dialect.
            :param existing_type: Optional; a
             :class:`~sqlalchemy.types.TypeEngine`
             type object to specify the previous type.   This
             is required for all MySQL column alter operations that
             don't otherwise specify a new type, as well as for
             when nullability is being changed on a SQL Server
             column.  It is also used if the type is a so-called
             SQLAlchemy "schema" type which may define a constraint (i.e.
             :class:`~sqlalchemy.types.Boolean`,
             :class:`~sqlalchemy.types.Enum`),
             so that the constraint can be dropped.
            :param existing_server_default: Optional; The existing
             default value of the column.   Required on MySQL if
             an existing default is not being changed; else MySQL
             removes the default.
            :param existing_nullable: Optional; the existing nullability
             of the column.  Required on MySQL if the existing nullability
             is not being changed; else MySQL sets this to NULL.
            :param existing_autoincrement: Optional; the existing autoincrement
             of the column.  Used for MySQL's system of altering a column
             that specifies ``AUTO_INCREMENT``.
            :param existing_comment: string text of the existing comment on the
             column to be maintained.  Required on MySQL if the existing comment
             on the column is not being changed.
            :param schema: Optional schema name to operate within.  To control
             quoting of the schema outside of the default behavior, use
             the SQLAlchemy construct
             :class:`~sqlalchemy.sql.elements.quoted_name`.
            :param postgresql_using: String argument which will indicate a
             SQL expression to render within the Postgresql-specific USING clause
             within ALTER COLUMN.    This string is taken directly as raw SQL which
             must explicitly include any necessary quoting or escaping of tokens
             within the expression.

               list.   Setting this to False results in individual INSERT
               statements being emitted per parameter set, and is needed

                op.execute("INSERT INTO table (foo) VALUES ('some value')")

            Or it can be any kind of Core SQL Expression construct, such as
            below where we use an update construct::

                from sqlalchemy.sql import table, column
                from sqlalchemy import String
                from alembic import op

                account = table("account", column("name", String))
                op.execute(
                    account.update()
                    .where(account.c.name == op.inline_literal("account 1"))
                    .values({"name": op.inline_literal("account 2")})
                )

            Above, we made use of the SQLAlchemy
            :func:`sqlalchemy.sql.expression.table` and
            :func:`sqlalchemy.sql.expression.column` constructs to make a brief,
            ad-hoc table construct just for our UPDATE statement.  A full
            :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Table` construct of course works perfectly
            fine as well, though note it's a recommended practice to at least
            ensure the definition of a table is self-contained within the migration
            script, rather than imported from a module that may break compatibility
            with older migrations.

            In a SQL script context, the statement is emitted directly to the
            output stream.   There is *no* return result, however, as this
            function is oriented towards generating a change script
            that can run in "offline" mode.     Additionally, parameterized
            statements are discouraged here, as they *will not work* in offline
            mode.  Above, we use :meth:`.inline_literal` where parameters are
            to be used.

            For full interaction with a connected database where parameters can
            also be used normally, use the "bind" available from the context::

                from alembic import op

                connection = op.get_bind()

                connection.execute(
                    account.update()
                    .where(account.c.name == "account 1")
                    .values({"name": "account 2"})
                )

            Additionally, when passing the statement as a plain string, it is first
            coerced into a :func:`sqlalchemy.sql.expression.text` construct
            before being passed along.  In the less likely case that the
            literal SQL string contains a colon, it must be escaped with a
            backslash, as::

               op.execute(r"INSERT INTO table (foo) VALUES ('\:colon_value')")


            :param sqltext: Any legal SQLAlchemy expression, including:

            * a string
            * a :func:`sqlalchemy.sql.expression.text` construct.
            * a :func:`sqlalchemy.sql.expression.insert` construct.
            * a :func:`sqlalchemy.sql.expression.update` construct.
            * a :func:`sqlalchemy.sql.expression.delete` construct.
            * Any "executable" described in SQLAlchemy Core documentation,
              noting that no result set is returned.

            .. note::  when passing a plain string, the statement is coerced into
               a :func:`sqlalchemy.sql.expression.text` construct. This construct
               considers symbols with colons, e.g. ``:foo`` to be bound parameters.
               To avoid this, ensure that colon symbols are escaped, e.g.
               ``\:foo``.
