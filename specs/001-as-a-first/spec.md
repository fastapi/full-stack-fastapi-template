# Feature Specification: Mermaid ERD Diagram Documentation

**Feature Branch**: `001-as-a-first`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "As a first feature I want to generate a Mermaid ERD diagram as Documentation. I also want to add it to the spec kit constitution and approriate templates so that when we make changes to the any of the database @models.py we also update the ERD diagram."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the FastAPI Template project, I want to have an automatically generated Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) that visualizes the database schema, so that I can quickly understand the data model and relationships between entities without manually examining the SQLModel definitions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the database models are defined in `backend/app/models.py`, **When** I run the ERD generation process, **Then** I should receive a Mermaid ERD diagram showing all tables, their fields, data types, and relationships
2. **Given** I modify any database model in `models.py`, **When** I commit my changes, **Then** the ERD diagram should be automatically updated to reflect the new schema
3. **Given** the ERD diagram exists, **When** I view the project documentation, **Then** I should see the current ERD diagram displayed in a readable format
4. **Given** I am following the project's development workflow, **When** I make database model changes, **Then** the constitution and templates should remind me to update the ERD documentation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the ERD generation process encounters invalid or malformed model definitions?
- How does the system handle circular relationships between database entities?
- What occurs when model changes break the existing ERD generation process?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate a Mermaid ERD diagram from all database models (including those that may expand beyond `backend/app/models.py`)
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all database tables with their field names, data types, and constraints
- **FR-003**: System MUST show relationships between tables including foreign keys and cardinality
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically update the ERD diagram when database models are modified via git pre-commit hook
- **FR-005**: System MUST integrate ERD requirements into existing documentation principles in the project constitution
- **FR-006**: System MUST update project templates to include ERD maintenance requirements
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate ERD diagram accuracy by parsing SQLModel definitions and provide a manual validation checklist for developers
- **FR-008**: System MUST fail fast and show clear error messages when ERD generation encounters invalid or malformed model definitions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Database Models**: SQLModel classes that represent database tables (User, Item, etc.)
- **ERD Diagram**: Visual representation of database schema using Mermaid syntax
- **Model Relationships**: Foreign key constraints and associations between tables
- **Documentation**: Project documentation that includes the ERD diagram

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: ERD generation MUST complete within 30 seconds for schemas with up to 20 tables and 100 fields

## Clarifications

### Session 2024-12-19
- Q: When ERD generation fails, how should the system behave? ‚Üí A: Fail fast - stop the process and show clear error message
- Q: What are the acceptable performance targets for ERD generation? ‚Üí A: Complete within 30 seconds for schemas with up to 20 tables and 100 fields
- Q: How should the ERD diagram be automatically updated when database models are modified? ‚Üí A: Git pre-commit hook that regenerates ERD before commits
- Q: How should the system validate that the generated ERD diagram accurately represents the current database models? ‚Üí A: Parse and validate against SQLModel definitions only + manual validation checklist for developers
- Q: How should the ERD documentation requirements be integrated into the project constitution and templates? ‚Üí A: Add ERD requirements to existing documentation principles
