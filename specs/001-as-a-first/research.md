# Research: Mermaid ERD Diagram Documentation

## Mermaid ERD Syntax for SQLModel Relationships

**Decision**: Use Mermaid ERD syntax with explicit relationship notation
**Rationale**: Mermaid provides standardized ERD syntax that supports:
- Entity definitions with attributes
- Relationship cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
- Foreign key constraints
- Primary key identification
- Clear visual representation

**Alternatives considered**:
- PlantUML ERD: More complex syntax, requires additional dependencies
- Draw.io XML: Not text-based, harder to version control
- Custom diagram format: Would require custom rendering tools

## Git Pre-commit Hook Integration Patterns

**Decision**: Use pre-commit framework with custom hook for ERD generation
**Rationale**: Pre-commit framework provides:
- Standardized hook management
- Integration with existing project workflow
- Support for multiple hook types
- Easy installation and configuration

**Alternatives considered**:
- Native git hooks: Harder to manage and distribute
- CI/CD only: Doesn't catch issues before commit
- Manual process: Prone to human error and inconsistency

## SQLModel Introspection and Parsing Techniques

**Decision**: Use Python AST parsing and SQLModel metadata for model extraction
**Rationale**: AST parsing provides:
- Reliable model structure extraction
- Access to field types and constraints
- Relationship detection via SQLModel metadata
- No runtime database dependency

**Alternatives considered**:
- Database introspection: Requires active database connection
- Reflection-based parsing: Less reliable, runtime dependent
- Manual model mapping: Prone to errors and maintenance issues

## Documentation Integration Approaches

**Decision**: Generate ERD as Mermaid code blocks in Markdown documentation
**Rationale**: Markdown with Mermaid provides:
- Version control friendly format
- Easy integration with existing documentation
- Support for multiple diagram types
- Standard rendering in most documentation platforms

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate image files: Harder to maintain, not version control friendly
- Embedded HTML: More complex, platform dependent
- External documentation tools: Additional dependencies and complexity

## Error Handling and Validation

**Decision**: Implement fail-fast validation with clear error messages
**Rationale**: Fail-fast approach ensures:
- Immediate feedback on model issues
- Clear error messages for debugging
- Prevention of invalid ERD generation
- Integration with existing project error handling patterns

**Alternatives considered**:
- Graceful degradation: Could hide important model issues
- Warning system: Adds complexity without clear benefit
- Retry mechanisms: Not applicable to model parsing errors

## Performance Considerations

**Decision**: Generate ERD on-demand with reasonable performance expectations
**Rationale**: On-demand generation provides:
- Always up-to-date diagrams
- No stale documentation issues
- Reasonable performance for typical schemas
- Integration with git workflow

**Alternatives considered**:
- Cached generation: Risk of stale diagrams
- Background generation: Adds complexity
- Manual generation only: Defeats automation purpose
